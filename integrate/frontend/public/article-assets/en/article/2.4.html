<h1>Introduction: From "How" to
"Who"</h1><p>In our journey so far, we have cascaded strategy into
measurable KPIs, aligned those KPIs with a portfolio of initiatives, and
anchored all work in a defined process architecture. We have answered
"why," "what," and "how." We now address the most
critical question for execution: <b>"Who?"</b></p><p></p><p>Organizational structure is far more than a chart of
reporting lines; it is the backbone of accountability. In a transformation, its
purpose is to ensure that every strategic outcome, every leading KPI, and every
executable process has a clear and unambiguous owner. When structure is
unclear, static, or disconnected from <span>the real</span> work,
accountability evaporates, decision-making stalls, and the transformation loses
momentum.</p><h1>The Four-Level Cascade of Accountability</h1><p>Just as with KPIs and processes, the organizational
structure must <span>be viewed</span> as a cascaded hierarchy. Each
level has a distinct role in owning a specific layer of performance, creating a
clear line of sight from the executive suite to the front line.</p><p></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="624">

</table><h1>Dynamic Structure</h1><p>In a transformation context, a static org chart is a
liability. As the organization builds new capabilities and re-engineers its
processes, the structure must adapt in response. Roles will <span>be
created</span>, merged, or evolved.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the organizational structure should <span>be treated</span> as a dynamic, living <span>modela</span>
core component of the transformation architecture itself. This requires <span>a proactive</span> approach:</p><p></p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Map Roles to Processes</b>: Every L3 process must <span>be
explicitly mapped</span> to a role (Owner, Performer, Approver).</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Treat Vacancies as Risks</b>: A vacant role is not just an HR issue; it
is a critical <b>capability gap</b>. It
represents a break in the accountability chain and introduces predictable risk
to every process and KPI that depends on that role. This risk must <span>be flagged</span> in the transformation governance forum.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Plan Structural Evolution</b>: The future-state organizational design
is a key <span>deliverable</span> of the transformation and must <span>be planned</span> and managed like any other initiative.</p><p></p><p>This approach shifts the culture from a rigid bureaucracy to
an agile entity, where the structure <span>is designed</span> to
serve the strategy, not the other way around.</p><h1>The Horizontal Dimension</h1><p>While the vertical cascade creates top-to-bottom alignment,
the <b>horizontal cascade</b> uses
structure to break down silos. A leading KPI at the L2 Main Unit level is often
the sum of multiple operational KPIs owned by different L3 Sub-Units.</p><p></p><p>For example, the "Average Permit Approval Time"
(L2 KPI) for a department depends on the performance of the Application
Processing team, the Inspection team, and the Legal Review team. The
architectural model makes this shared dependency explicit. No single sub-unit
can succeed in isolation; they are structurally bound to collaborate to achieve
the collective goal.</p><h1>Key Takeaways</h1><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>An organization's structure
must <span>be designed</span> as a map of <b>accountability</b>, <span>directly linking</span> people to
processes and KPIs.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>Accountability cascades
through four levels, from the Entity Head owning strategic KPIs down to
individuals owning process metrics.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>In a transformation, the
structure must be <b>dynamic</b>, and a
vacant role must <span>be treated</span> as a critical <b>risk</b> to performance.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>The structure must <span>be designed</span> to enforce <b>horizontal
collaboration</b>, breaking down silos by making shared KPI dependencies
transparent.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>This accountability
framework is a critical layer of the <b>Digital
Twin</b>, allowing leaders to manage human capital risk and performance with
data-driven precision.</p><p></p>
