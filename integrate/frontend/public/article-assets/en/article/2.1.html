<h1>Introduction<span></span></h1><p>In Episode 1.4, we saw how public-sector transformation <span>is entangled</span>sector outcomes depend on organizational
capabilities, and each piece must align for change to happen. But how does a
Vision 2030 macro targetlike increase non-oil GDP<span>actually
cascade</span> down to something a department or analyst can influence?</p><p></p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span></span></span><?endif?><b>Episode Objective:</b><span> Translating macro ambitions into measurable,
manageable achievements that <span>aggregate</span></span></p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span></span></span><?endif?><b>Context:</b><span> Using Saudi Arabias real indicators and
transformation contexts</span></p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span></span></span><?endif?><b>Example:</b><span> See the cascade under the microscope as we
examine the essential role of formulas in cascading</span></p><h1>Why Cascading Matters in Vision 2030<span></span></h1><p>Vision 2030 sets ambitious, sector-wide targets. But success
requires breaking each goal into actionable, owned, and reviewed KPIsfrom the
national level all the way down to L3 frontline process metrics. The cascade <span>isnt</span> just <span>verticalsome leading and
operational KPIs link horizontally across ministries or agencies, making
collaboration essential.</span></p><h2>Indicator Types<span></span></h2><p>The best way to explain the cascade is to take an example
from the highest level all the way down. For <span>our example</span>,
we choose the GDP as one of the most common and visible economic indicators.</p><p></p><p>But first, <span>lets</span> understand how our
definitions fit in this context. Think of the Saudi economy as a high-tech
dashboard. Each gauge (indicator) helps leaders steer toward Vision 2030. There
are three types we are interested in for the moment:</p><p></p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Lagging Indicators</b>: These are like taillights, showing where <span>weve</span> been. They change <i><span>after</span></i>the
economy shifts, confirming past trends. Example: Government spending more after
a bad year to <span>help out</span>.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Leading Indicators</b>: These are like headlights, showing <span>whats</span> coming. They change <i><span>before</span></i>the economy does, hinting at future growth or slowdowns. Example:
Businesses investing in new factories because they expect more sales.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Coincident Indicators</b>: These are like your speedometer, showing <span>whats</span> happening now. They move <i><span>with</span></i>the economy, reflecting its current state. Example: The number of people
with jobs <span>rising</span> as the economy grows.</p><p></p><p>In Saudi Arabia, with its mix of oil and Vision 2030s push
for tourism and industry, these indicators help leaders like the Ministry of
Finance or GASTAT (the stats agency) steer the economy.</p><h1>GDP Formula Components<span></span></h1><p>Saudi Arabia uses the expenditure approach to GDP:</p><p></p><p><?if !msEquation?><span><?if !vml?><?endif?></span><?endif?></p><p></p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>C (Consumption)</b>: Money people spend on stuff like food, clothes, or
trips. In Saudi Arabia, this includes locals buying groceries or tourists
spending at Riyadh Season.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>I (Investment)</b>: Money businesses or the government spend on future
projects, like factories, hotels, or NEOMs skyscrapers.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>G (Government Spending)</b>: Money the government spends on schools,
hospitals, or roads, tracked through budgets on Saudi Arabias Etimad system.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>X (Exports)</b>: Value of what Saudi Arabia sells abroad, like oil,
chemicals, or tourism services for foreign visitors.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>M (Imports)</b>: Value of what Saudi Arabia buys from other countries,
like cars or tech.</p><h1>How Do They Impact the Economy?<span></span></h1><p>This simple question not only helps identify them quickly
(as you will see in a moment), but it helps you understand the state of the
economy with one quick glance.</p><p></p><p>To figure out if an indicator is leading, lagging, or
coincident, ask: <b>Does it move before,
with, or after the economy?</b></p><p></p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>Government Spending (G)
is a lagging indicatormoves after the GDP, responds after the economy shifts.
Same applies for C, X, and M.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>Investment (I) is a
classic leading indicatormoves before GDP and leads the economy.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>Employment is coincidentmoves
with GDP, and it <span>is illustrated</span> exactly because it is
not in the formula. Coincident indicators (relative to another indicator)
rarely appear in the same formula, as they run in parallel and <span>are usually influenced</span> by the same factors in the same
manner.</p><h1>Quarterly Shifts<span></span></h1><p><span>Lets</span> look at how these moves
(after, before, with) manifest visually.</p><p></p><p>Look for the pattern. All the indicators charts look <span>very similar</span> to the GDP one but shifted in time per <span>the definition</span>:</p><p></p><p><span><?if !vml?><?endif?></span><i>Lagging Indicator: Government Spending Follows
GDP </i></p><p></p><p><b><span><?if !vml?><?endif?></span></b><i>Leading Indicator: Investment Moves Before
GDP</i></p><p></p><p><i><span><?if !vml?><?endif?></span></i></p><p><i>Coincident Indicator: Employment Moves With GDP </i></p><h1>Turning Macro Targets into Transformation KPIs<span></span></h1><p>Each ministry contributes to GDP in <span>different
ways</span>, some more than others. <span>Some</span> drive
Investment (I), others drive Government Spending (G) like Health, or
Consumption (C) like Tourism. In this example, we trace the Ministry of
Investments full line of sight down to the working level, but the same cascade
logic applies across all components and owners.</p><p></p><p>To turn a Vision 2030 macro target into actionable change,
we break it down into a structured, formula-driven KPI cascade with clear
ownership at every level.</p><p></p><p>In this example, we trace the Ministry of Investments
contribution (I for Investment) all the way down to L3.</p><h2>KPI Cascade Example: Ministry of Investments

</table><p></p><p>Here, the cascade ends as far as the Transformation is
responsible. This is because L3 processes <span>are not performed</span>
by an individual; rarely <span>any are</span> like that.</p><p></p><p>Individuals can perform specific tasks described in step-by-step
procedures, usually referred to as L4 and L5.</p><p></p><p>The link does not stop though, as it continues through a
handshake with the HR individual performance reviews. This is usually based on Job
Descriptions (JDs) and competencies to measure performance against them.</p><p></p><p><span>Thats</span> why it is critical that the
HR Performance system <span>is designed</span> with the L3
Processes in mind. If not, then there will be a disconnect.</p><h1>Governance, Measurement, and Intervention<span></span></h1><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Ownership</b>: Each KPI (at every level) has a named business owner,
data owner, and <span>is reviewed</span> in a regular cadence
meeting.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Measurement</b>: We loosely use the term KPI, yet it contains the
baseline, target, actual, trend, varianceall must <span>be tracked</span>.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Intervention</b>:</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>In the absence of a
cascade, interventions are after the fact, and sadly by external observers. Yet
even in such cases, tracing the problem becomes seamless.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?>In a cascade, the
intervention holds foresight and predicts ahead of time any challenges,
allowing time to prevent or mitigate the impact.</p><h2>The Big Unlock<span></span></h2><p>This kind of cascade has <span>many</span>
benefits, yet these might be the biggest two by far:</p><p></p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Priorities</b>: A fragmented entity can <span>be easily spotted</span>
when there is continuous debate on what should be the priority? Conflicting
opinions and resistance to collaborate or adopt major programs.</p><p><?if !supportLists?><span><span>-</span></span><?endif?><b>Cross-Department Collaboration</b>: We always knew KPIs influence
behaviors, and in a normal vertical cascade, it can even reach to influence
individuals. Yet the Horizontal cascade brings genuine buy-in that is more
powerful and effective than <span>many</span> change programs.</p><h1>Key Takeaways<span></span></h1><ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Vision 2030 macro goals
     become <span>real only</span> when they <span>are
     broken</span> into clear KPI cascadeseach owned, measured, and linked to
     specific actions.</li>
<li>Strategic Leading
     Indicators (like Investment) are the critical entry point for ministries
     and organizations to shape their organizations around national results.</li>
<li>Every lagging KPI must <span>be connected</span>, via explicit formulas, to leading, then
     operational, and then <span>process metricstying</span>
     external variables and internal performance together.</li>
<li>Measurement, ownership,
     and intervention <span>are disciplined</span>, regular, and
     actionable at every step of the chain.</li>
<li>Collaboration matters:
     Horizontal cascading and external drivers must <span>be
     managed</span>not just <span>siloed</span> KPIs.</li>
