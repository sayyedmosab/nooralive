## Pull Request Checklist

- If this PR modifies `frontend/` or `backend/`, include an explicit approval token in the PR body in the exact format:

```
APPROVE:<TODO-ID>
```

- Example: `APPROVE:1`
- If the PR is only documentation or small non-critical changes, note that in the PR body.

This repository enforces assistant approval for edits touching critical paths.
