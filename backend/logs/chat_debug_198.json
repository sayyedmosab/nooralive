You have direct MCP access to Neo4j and must not use intermediaries or routing layers.\n\n---\n\n### BEHAVIORAL LOGIC\n\nIf this is the first user turn:\n\n1. Identify Intent\n   1.1. Directly from the user query and/or prior context.\n   1.2. If unclear, query embeddings via Neo4j vector search.\n   1.3. If confidence remains below 0.5, ask clarification questions.\n\n2. Retrieve Data\n   Use Neo4j Cypher queries to collect relevant data.\n\n3. Analyze Data\n   Perform analytical review: patterns, trends, correlations, anomalies.\n\n4. Structure Response\n\n   * Present tabular data (\u22645 columns, \u226420 rows).\n   * If appropriate, include visualization in valid Highcharts JSON format.\n   * Summarize statistical and business insights.\n\nIf this is a subsequent turn, derive context from conversation history before taking any action.\n\n---\n\n### TOOLCHAIN (MCP TOOLS)\n\n1. get_neo4j_schema\n\n   * Use only if schema information is missing or inconsistent.\n   * Returns database structure (labels, properties, relationships).\n\n2. read_neo4j_cypher\n\n   * Primary data retrieval tool.\n   * Use for all queries once schema is known.\n\nRules:\n\n* Maximum three Cypher queries per turn.\n* Always filter by year when applicable.\n* Limit results to 20 rows unless user specifies otherwise.\n* Order by year DESC, name ASC when relevant.\n* Use COUNT(), SUM(), AVG() for aggregations.\n* Use DISTINCT to avoid duplication.\n\n---\n\n### DATABASE SCHEMA (VERIFIED FROM NEO4J)\n\n#### Sector Entities

So we need to retrieve relationships: EntityCapability linked to EntityITSystem, EntityOrgUnit, EntityProcess, and also linked to EntityProject (maybe via OPERATES or other relationships). According to schema: relationships: OPERATES: EntityOrgUnit/EntityProcess/EntityITSystem \u2192 EntityCapability (i.e., they operate capability). Also EXECUTES: EntityCapability \u2192 SectorPolicyTool. But we need capability linked to projects: maybe via SETS_PRIORITIES? Actually SETS_PRIORITIES: SectorPolicyTool \u2192 EntityCapability. Not direct. But maybe there is relationship: EntityProject linked to EntityCapability via ??? Not defined. Could be via SETS_PRIORITIES? Not. However we can infer via relationship chain: EntityProject \u2192 EntityChangeAdoption (ADOPTION_EntityRisk) but not capability. However we can still produce inferred relations: show which capabilities are associated with which IT systems, org units, processes, and which projects are linked (maybe via some relationship like EXECUTES? Not defined). Could use pattern: (c:EntityCapability)-[:OPERATES]->(i:EntityITSystem) etc. Actually OPERATES direction is EntityITSystem \u2192 EntityCapability. So we can match (i)-[:OPERATES]->(c). Similarly (o)-[:OPERATES]->(c) and (p)-[:OPERATES]->(c). Then also find projects that are linked to those capabilities maybe via SETS_PRIORITIES? Actually SETS_PRIORITIES: SectorPolicyTool \u2192 EntityCapability. Not project. Could be via EXECUTES: EntityCapability \u2192 SectorPolicyTool. Not project.\n\nMaybe there is relationship: EntityProject \u2192 EntityCapability via something like \"SETS_TARGETS\"? Not defined. Could be missing. But we can infer via common capability ID? Not.\n\nGiven limited schema, we can produce table with columns: Capability ID, Capability Name, IT System IDs (comma), Org Unit IDs (comma), Process IDs (comma), Project IDs (maybe none). We can query for each capability and collect related nodes.\n\nWe need to limit rows to 20. We'll retrieve top 20 capabilities ordered by year DESC.\n\nCypher: MATCH (c:EntityCapability)\nOPTIONAL MATCH (i:EntityITSystem)-[:OPERATES]->(c)\nOPTIONAL MATCH (o:EntityOrgUnit)-[:OPERATES]->(c)\nOPTIONAL MATCH (pr:EntityProcess)-[:OPERATES]->(c)\nOPTIONAL MATCH (proj:EntityProject)-[:?]->(c) // unknown relationship; maybe we can use pattern where project has a relationship to capability via something like \"SET_TARGETS\"? Not defined. Could skip projects or try to find any relationship between project and capability: MATCH (proj:EntityProject)-[r]-(c) where type(r) in [...]? Not.\n\nBetter to just include projects that have a relationship to capability via any relationship: MATCH (proj:EntityProject)-[r]-(c) RETURN distinct proj. That may capture any.\n\nWe'll aggregate IDs using collect(distinct i.id) etc.\n\nReturn: c.id as capability_id, c.name as capability_name, collect(distinct i.id) as it_system_ids, collect(distinct o.id) as org_unit_ids, collect(distinct pr.id) as process_ids, collect(distinct proj.id) as project_ids.\n\nLimit 20.\n\nLet's craft query.\n\n"
